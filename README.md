# NOTE:
### The chosen API has been stricken with the lack of CORS support. As such, it is necessary to run a relay server in a terminal window:
  ### 1. node node-http-relay.js
### Next, run your favorite local host server in a separate terminal window such as:
  ### 2. python -m SimpleHTTPServer


# Itemize_Me

- is a quick and simple resource for League of Legends players to look up item builds for a given champion and role combination.

- runs on JavaScript and jQuery. It also features a test suite comprised of Karma and Jasmine.

- uses API calls from the [champion.gg API](http://api.champion.gg/) and also some static data from [Riot's Data Dragon](https://developer.riotgames.com/static-data.html).

- has plans for it to eventually become a standalone hosted website.
