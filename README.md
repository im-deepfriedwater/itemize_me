# Itemize_Me

- is a quick and simple resource for League of Legends players to look up item builds for a given champion and role combination.

- runs on JavaScript and jQuery. It also features a test suite comprised of Karma and Jasmine.

- uses API calls from the [champion.gg API](http://api.champion.gg/) and also some static data from [Riot's Data Dragon](https://developer.riotgames.com/static-data.html).

- UX design is still a WIP!
